# Veterinary Web App

This is a programmable web application where different medical schedules can be entered for various pets and their needs.  A simple example would be to send a greeting when a day prior to the pet's birthday.  A more complex example would be is to send a reminder to the owner that his pet needs to visit the clinic on particular dates for treatment of a particular ailment.  Thus this app can function as a Veterinarian's secretary.

This was a project in 2008-2009 and wasn't touched since then.
